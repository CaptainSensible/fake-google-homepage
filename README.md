This is the first build project (easy version) for the Odin Project curriculum. I have no idea what I am doing so here goes nothin.....

3 things I am not fully happy with.

1. Icons in the top right. I could not get them to move down and really center to the rest of the line.
	Every time i found a way to move them down it would move all the icons on the right.
2. I could not get the mic icon for voice search within the search bar.
3. The settings link at the bottom right doesnt underline when you hover over it.

how its put together
the top bits are 2 horizontal lists one is floated right.
